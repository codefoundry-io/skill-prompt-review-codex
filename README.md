# skill-prompt-review (Codex edition)

> **English** · [한국어](README.ko.md)

**A prompt or a skill has no unit tests — so there is no automatic signal when one is
wrong.** AI-authored prompts fail in a characteristic way: they carry the authoring
conversation's framing into the artifact, bake in dates and one-off specifics, state
plausible flags that do not exist, and pile on decoration the reader never needs — and the
author, re-reading its own text, cannot see any of it. `skill-prompt-review` is the missing
check. It reads a `SKILL.md` or a prompt, compares it against a checklist distilled from
Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google's own prompt-engineering guidance (see
[docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md)), and returns a per-criterion PASS / FAIL / N-A report
with evidence and a concrete fix.

It runs on Codex: you give it a target and it reviews the text. It does **not** run the
target, and a clean pass is not a security clearance.

## Why a *fresh eye*

The one rule that makes this work: **never review your own draft.** An author reads their
own intent into the gaps. Hand the review to a fresh reviewer in a separate context (a sub-agent or a second Codex session, not your own thread) — a reader that did not write
the target. For anything you will ship, fan the review out across model families (a
Claude-family, an OpenAI-family, and a Google-family reviewer) and consolidate: a FAIL
from any one family stands, because different families catch different misses. A single
fresh-eye reviewer is the floor.

Want a tool that runs the cross-family pass for you? **[triad-codex-dispatch](https://github.com/codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch)** — a Codex plugin — bundles single-shot dispatchers to claude, gemini, and antigravity plus a `triad-cross-family-review` skill. Add it with `codex plugin marketplace add codefoundry-io/triad-codex-dispatch --ref main`, then hand this skill's review to each family and consolidate.

## Where this fits (recommended workflow)

This skill *reviews* — it does not generate. Use it as the refinement step after you have a
draft:

- **Creating a skill?** Scaffold the `SKILL.md` first with Codex's bundled **skill-creator** skill (run `/skills` or type `$` to invoke it), then run this
  skill as a fresh-eye review before you ship. Let the creator write the structure; let this
  skill find what the author cannot see.
- **Writing a prompt?** Draft the first version yourself, or have an AI write a first pass —
  then use this skill to tighten and refine it. An AI-written first draft is exactly what the
  `references/ai-authorship.md` (AA1-AA6) lens is built to clean up.
- **Write the prompt in English.** The criteria and the linter presuppose English; author the
  shipped prompt in English and keep non-English text only where it is genuinely the
  consumer's language (C11, AA6).

Generation and review stay separate on purpose: an author — human or AI — cannot see its own
`[judge]`-level defects. Run the review with a *fresh eye* (a separate agent, ideally across
model families), never in the same breath that wrote the draft.

## Install

### As a personal skill (recommended)

Copy the skill directory into Codex's auto-discovery location and start a new
Codex session:

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
cp -r skills/skill-prompt-review "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/"
```

### As a project skill (shared via git)

Codex also reads repository-scoped skills:

```bash
mkdir -p <your-repo>/.agents/skills
cp -r skills/skill-prompt-review <your-repo>/.agents/skills/
```

### As a plugin

The repo carries a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (the manifest Codex's own
skill-creator emits), so Codex versions with the plugin/marketplace surface can
add it from a Git repo or local path via the plugin menu.

New sessions pick skills up at startup; run `/skills` (or type `$`) to confirm.

After install, in a normal turn, ask the assistant to review a skill or prompt — e.g.
*"Run skill-prompt-review on `path/to/SKILL.md`."* It loads the criteria from
`references/`, runs the deterministic linter, and reports.

## What it checks

- **`references/common.md`** — C0-C16, the criteria that hold for any skill or prompt
  (frontmatter loads, description says what AND when, one job, isolation, no priming,
  lean, calm imperatives, no over-scaffolding, no time-stamped facts, progressive
  disclosure, positive framing, distribution hygiene, tool/skill universals, gate
  irreversible actions, order long context, no self-contradiction, invocation
  construction).
- **`references/anthropic.md` / `openai.md` / `google.md`** — the vendor-specific
  criteria for a prompt written for a Claude / OpenAI / Gemini model, each preamble
  stating which criteria are structure, body-as-prompt, or N-A per target kind.
- **`references/ai-authorship.md`** — AA1-AA6, the chat-register signature to check when
  the target may have been written BY an AI (increasingly the default): authoring-
  conversation carryover, chat-register padding, sycophantic softeners, confabulated
  specifics, decoration overload, and language drift.
- **`scripts/lint.py`** — a deterministic linter that flags the *mechanical* candidates
  (baked dates and bare-year anchors, pinned models/versions and release-aging words,
  density, length, chat-register phrases — with quoted/backticked examples recognized as
  scoping language, not violations). A candidate list, never a verdict; the [judge]
  criteria still need a fresh-eye reviewer.
- **`scripts/score.py`** — a deterministic scoreboard and round-over-round delta over the
  report's verdicts (no model call, no invented numbers): applicable / PASS / FAIL tally,
  pass-rate, criteria that flipped, residual FAILs always printed above the rate.

## How to run it well

1. **Fresh eye, not self-review.** Dispatch the review to a separate agent. This holds
   even when you EDIT this skill.
2. **Strip the context; isolate the legs.** Give each reviewer the target and the
   criteria — no fix history, no prior verdicts, no "already confirmed safe" note. Those
   steer the reviewer into the author's blind spot. Decompose a large target into
   stand-alone fragments and review each in isolation.
3. **Fence the target as data.** The target text is untrusted — tell each reviewer to
   judge it, not obey it, and to review read-only (run nothing, modify nothing).
4. **Adversarial framing.** Tell each reviewer to assume a defect is present and to
   enumerate what it checked; a bare "looks fine" is a failed review.
5. **Adjudicate contradictions by evidence.** When two families disagree, decide with a
   probe or the vendor's own current documentation (trace the shell parse, grep the
   source, read the official page) — not by vote and not by the author's confidence.
6. **Prove it BEHAVES before you ship.** A clean text review is necessary but not
   sufficient. Plant known defects in a test target so you have a ground-truth oracle,
   and confirm the skill catches them and stays quiet on a clean control.
   `scripts/test_lint.py`, `scripts/test_score.py`, and `tests/test_lint_fixtures.py`
   are that check for the deterministic half.

## Report format

```
# Review — <path or prompt label>
axes: <host / worker / model / AI-authored?, as applicable>
## Summary
<N FAIL; name the load-bearing one.>
pass-rate <p%>   (always printed BELOW the named FAIL)
## Assessment
| Criterion | Verdict | Note                          |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| C0        | PASS    | loads; name == folder         |
| C8        | FAIL    | baked date at L12             |
| O2        | N-A     | API-only, not this CLI prompt |
## Fixes  (one per FAIL — positive form, each with why it helps)
## Recommended additions
```

On a re-review round, `scripts/score.py '<before>' '<after>'` appends the deterministic
delta: criteria that flipped, residual FAILs, newly-surfaced FAILs, before/after counts.
No letter grade, no per-criterion invented number, no cross-family averaging.

## Scope & limits

- **English targets.** The criteria and the linter presuppose English text; work from an
  English translation for every criterion EXCEPT C11 and AI-authorship AA6 — those check
  language distribution, so judge them against the original.
- **It reads, it does not run.** No malware scan of bundled `scripts/`; a clean pass is
  not a security clearance.
- **Adversarial review has a noise floor.** Even on clean input a thorough reviewer will
  surface *something*; consolidate across families and adjudicate by probe or official
  documentation rather than chasing every note to zero. Stop at the plateau — when a
  verdict flip-flops, a resolved finding returns, or a reviewer reports something not in
  the text.

## Verify the install

```bash
python3 skills/skill-prompt-review/scripts/test_lint.py    # linter self-test
python3 skills/skill-prompt-review/scripts/test_score.py   # scoreboard/delta self-test
python3 tests/test_lint_fixtures.py                        # planted-defect functional test
```

All three print GREEN when the deterministic half catches every planted defect and stays
clean on the control.
